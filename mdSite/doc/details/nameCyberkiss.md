###The name cyberkiss
The simplicity of the querystring of a http or https request stands in great contrast to those numbers of 100K bytes javascript that often facilitates it in a web userface. It is NOT simple - the webbrowser, albeit often not obvious on modern computers, does a lot of work. 

'Kisses' is another word for api's, the kept simple and stupid needed functionality to transform a text to a, often querysting postfixed, url.
